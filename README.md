# Hooks

Hooks are small, efficient WebAssembly modules designed specifically for the XRPL. They could be referred to as **Smart Contracts for the XRP Ledger Protocol**.

Hooks can be written in any language (compilable to WebAssembly) and most business logic and most smart contract concepts can be implemented in a hook.
